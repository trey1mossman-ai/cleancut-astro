              Clean Cut is proudly rooted in Decatur, Illinois, serving homes and businesses throughout Central Illinois. Ken Clark founded Clean Cut Painting & Handyman in 2016, building a strong foundation centered on cleanliness, professionalism, quality workmanship and reliability.</p><p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">After Ken's unexpected passing, it was deeply important to the Clark Family that his legacy continue. In early 2018, Dara and Colby Geiser stepped in to carry that vision forward, bringing with them over 30 years of combined industry experience and a commitment to honoring the standard Ken established.</p><p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">Clean Cut Painting and Handyman's mission has always remained simple: Deliver reliable, high-quality work that clients can trust while preserving the legacy that started it all.
