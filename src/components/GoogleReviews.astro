Tyler, the Chief Revenue Officer and Manager, was absolutely amazing—always quick to answer our calls, emails, and texts, and made sure everything ran smoothly from start to finish. Gustavo and Valeria were the painters, and they did a fantastic job! They painted the entire house ceiling, including the garage, and you'd never even know they'd been here except for how beautiful everything looks now.",

    text: "I hired Clean Cut to paint the windows and sills on my 2 story house. I think there were approximately 40 windows total. The painter was very professional, courteous, and thorough. He took time and care with the taping of the windows and the prep work. His finished work was excellent! He was very thorough with the clean up afterwards! I definitely would recommend them and plan on doing different projects in the future with them. Communication before, during, and afterwards with Clean Cut was excellent as well!",
